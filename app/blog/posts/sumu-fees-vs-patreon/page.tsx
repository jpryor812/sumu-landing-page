        Maybe you&apos;ve heard of Asianometry, one of the most popular, and my personal favorite, YouTube channels.

      <p className="mb-8 md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
        Since it&apos;s incredibly difficult to earn a living wage from YouTube payouts, Jon, the creator of Asianometry, created a Patreon channel where he charges fans $6 for early access to his videos. He likely pays the 8% platform fee to Patreon, though he could be paying up to 12%, and pays 2.9% + $0.30 for U.S. payments and 3.9% + $0.30 for international payments.
      </p>

                height={400}
                className="rounded-lg shadow-md w-1/2"

                width={400}  
                height={400}

            />
        </div>

      <p className="mb-8 md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
        Let&apos;s assume a 50/50 split in his fans in terms of international and U.S.-based to say, on average, Jon pays 8% + 3.4% + $0.30 per subscriber per month to Patreon and payment processing companies. Therefore, on a $6-a-month transaction, Jon is losing about $0.98 of his earnings per transaction, close to 17%!
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8 md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
        So, despite Patreon marketing an 8% platform fee, creators who charge a low price for their content could lose around 17% of their earnings! So, if Jon wanted to make $72,000 a year for his content, he would&apos;t need 1,000 fans paying $6 a month; he would actually need about 1,200 fans paying $6 a month! That means about 200 of those 1200 fans are paying Patreon and payment processing companiesâ€”not Jon.

        Instead, Jon should use Sumu and retain more of his earnings.
      </p>

      <div className="mb-8 md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
        <p className="font-bold">
          First, Sumu&apos;s platform fee is 4.9%, with 0% transaction fees in the U.S. and internationally. Therefore, if Jon were to use Sumu with 1,000 fans paying $6 a month, he would save almost $10,000 just from fees. Think about what you could do with $10,000, especially without having to do any extra work!
        </p>
        </div>

      <div className="my-8 flex justify-center">

          width={400}
          height={400}
          className="rounded-lg shadow-md"
        />
      </div>

      <p className="mb-8 md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
        Also, Sumu rewards top creators with actual USDC back, up to $100s a month, and even gives creators ownership in Sumu itself. Therefore, as the company becomes more valuable, creators&pos; shares in Sumu similarly get more valuable! If Jon were to join as an early creator and the platform were to become as successful as Patreon, that $72,000 he was shooting for from his fans could be dwarfed by his actual ownership in Sumu. Plus, this ownership is of no cost to him; it is purely a reward for being on Sumu.
